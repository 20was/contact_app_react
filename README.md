## Contact React App

This app manages the details of a user. It helps to search, insert and delete contacts.
Data comes from backend server, so needs to run server first in order to see app completely.

The backend server for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-contacts-server)

Clone it and run a command node server.js
